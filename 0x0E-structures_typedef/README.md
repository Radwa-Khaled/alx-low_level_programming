1-init_dog.c: This function initializes a variable of type struct dog. It takes parameters such as the dog's name, age, and owner, and assigns these values to the corresponding members of the struct dog variable.

2-print_dog.c: This function prints the details of a struct dog variable. It takes a struct dog as input and prints its name, age, and owner.

4-new_dog.c: This function creates a new dog dynamically. It takes parameters such as the dog's name, age, and owner, and allocates memory for a new struct dog variable. It then assigns the given values to the corresponding members of the newly created struct dog and returns a pointer to it.

5-free_dog.c: This function frees the memory allocated for a struct dog variable. It takes a pointer to a struct dog and uses the free() function to deallocate the memory. This function should be called when the struct dog is no longer needed to prevent memory leaks.
